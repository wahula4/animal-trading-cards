			<p>The animal is best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), beaver (tail),
				and otter (body and fur). Males are also venomous. They have sharp stingers on the heels of their rear feet and can use
				them to deliver a strong toxic blow to any foe.</p>
